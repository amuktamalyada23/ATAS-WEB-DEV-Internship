      <p class="content">
      The accounting cycle is the process of accepting, recording, sorting, and crediting payments 
      made and received within a business during a particular accounting period. Companies generally 
      balance their books each quarter and then again at year-end, 
      though others may prefer to settle the books every day or every week – that’s a lot of work, 
      but it can be done if you choose to.

      Based on the transactions recorded as part of the accounting cycle, financial statements such
       as cash flow reports, profit and loss statements, and balance sheets can be prepared. Once 
       all the business accounts have been balanced, they are closed out for that period and new 
       ones created for the next accounting period.
       The key steps in the eight-step accounting cycle include recording journal entries, posting
        to the general ledger, 
       calculating trial balances, making adjusting entries, and creating financial statements.
