        Every Document is thoroughly studied for itâ€™s accuracy and completeness. Further, the eCA will then
         call you to discuss your income, investments & deductions to help you get the maximum refund.
        Leave all the hard work on us, to maximise deductions and save taxes for you.
         We know everything about the tax laws applicable 
        on you. We also check Form 26AS with the Department to get you the max. benefit of your TDS.
        A detailed summary of your Income Tax Return is sent to you for your approval. 
        Once approved, we file it for you.
        The Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Income Tax Rules, 1962, obligates citizens to file returns
         with the Income Tax Department at the end of every financial year.[2] These returns should be 
         filed before the specified due date. Every Income Tax Return Form is applicable to a certain 
         section of the Assessees. Only those Forms which are filed by the eligible Assessees are processed by the Income Tax Department of India. It is therefore imperative to know which particular form is appropriate in each case. Income Tax Return Forms vary 
        depending on the criteria of the source of income of the Assessee and the category of the Assessee.
